Just Run It is a source-available platform for sharing and running code.

## Technology

It's built with:

- Elixir

Because it has nice syntax and offers scalability.

- Phoenix Framework

As elixir isn't enough to build a whole web app.

- Svelte

For building an internal code editor in combination with [Code Mirror](https://codemirror.net).

- PostgreSQL

As a main database.

- MinIO

For storing file uploads.
